# Gauss
Gaussian integer class and some stuff related to quadratic residues and the 3x+1 problem. Made in a day after I learned about lambda expressions, so don't expect much. Some of the cplot stuff might be wonky, but I will actually do more with this as I learn more python!

Ahh, forgot to mention that not all integers have Gaussian integers associated with them (the pop function finds them), and I am gonna guess that is where a specific error is coming from. If you get a math domain error using cplot, try checking using pop and see if you get an error or an empty list. I'll check later.
